## Level 1: Foundational Philosophy

**Purpose:** Defines WHY this product must exist and WHAT core experiences it creates. This document contains the philosophical and experiential foundations that should never change.

**Reference Rules:** External resources only. Cannot reference any project documents.

> **Note:** This template follows the Hierarchical Specification Framework v2.0.0, which introduced Design Pillars as a core component of Level 1. See [CHANGELOG.md](../CHANGELOG.md) for details.

## Mission

[Why this product must exist. Focus on the problem being solved and the transformation you're creating, not features or implementation. 1-3 paragraphs.]

**Example:**
> Transform how people [interact with domain] by prioritizing [core value] over [traditional approach]. We believe [fundamental truth about users/problem]. This product exists to [specific transformation or change].

---

## Design Pillars

These 3-5 core experiences define what this product IS. Every feature must support at least one pillar.

Design pillars focus on how users will FEEL, not what they will do. They serve as decision filters throughout development.

### 1. [PILLAR NAME]

[One-sentence emotional statement describing the core feeling/experience]

**What this means:**
[Paragraph explaining the feeling or emotion users should experience. Be specific about the emotional state or experience quality.]

**User perspective:**
"I feel [specific emotion] when [interaction or context]"

**Examples:**
- [Concrete example of what this pillar means in practice]
- [Another concrete example]

---

### 2. [PILLAR NAME]

[One-sentence emotional statement describing the core feeling/experience]

**What this means:**
[Paragraph explaining the feeling or emotion users should experience.]

**User perspective:**
"I feel [specific emotion] when [interaction or context]"

**Examples:**
- [Concrete example of what this pillar means in practice]
- [Another concrete example]

---

### 3. [PILLAR NAME]

[One-sentence emotional statement describing the core feeling/experience]

**What this means:**
[Paragraph explaining the feeling or emotion users should experience.]

**User perspective:**
"I feel [specific emotion] when [interaction or context]"

**Examples:**
- [Concrete example of what this pillar means in practice]
- [Another concrete example]

_[Optional: Add 4th and 5th pillars if needed, but resist going beyond 5 core experiences]_

## Inviolable Principles

These constraints cannot be violated under any circumstances, even if it costs features, users, or revenue.

- **Never [principle]:** [Why this matters philosophically. How it connects to mission or pillars.]
- **Always [principle]:** [Rationale for this commitment.]
- **No [constraint]:** [What this prevents and why.]

**Example:**
- **Never create guilt or punishment mechanics:** Users should feel energized by the product, not anxious about falling behind. (Supports "Sustainable Engagement" pillar)
- **Always respect user time and attention:** No dark patterns, no infinite scroll, no manipulative retention tactics.
- **No data exploitation:** User data is sacred and private, never sold or used for purposes beyond product functionality.

---

## North-Star Experience

[Aspirational description of the ideal user experience if the product fully succeeds. Paint a picture of how users' lives will be different. 1-3 paragraphs.]

**If we succeed:**
- Users will [behavioral change or emotional transformation]
- [Specific outcome in users' lives after 6 months]
- [Long-term impact or relationship with the product]

**Example:**
> If we succeed, users will feel energized and in control of their work, not overwhelmed by endless task lists. They'll accomplish meaningful goals without guilt or burnout. The product becomes a trusted partner that adapts to their energy levels and life rhythms, celebrating effort rather than demanding perfection. After 6 months, users will describe feeling "lighter" and more confident in their ability to manage their commitments sustainably.

---

## Anti-Goals

[What this product explicitly will NOT do or be. Defining boundaries through exclusion.]

**This product is NOT:**
- [What it won't be or do]
- [Another boundary]
- [Another exclusion]

**This product is NOT FOR:**
- [User type or use case that's out of scope]
- [Another user type to exclude]

**Example:**
- NOT a comprehensive project management suite (we focus on individual task management)
- NOT for teams managing complex multi-person workflows
- NOT optimizing for maximum productivity at all costs (we prioritize sustainability)

---

## External References

[Optional: Key external resources, research, or frameworks that inform this philosophy]

- [Citation or link to relevant research]
- [Reference to philosophical framework or methodology]
- [Other foundational sources]

**Example:**
- Nir Eyal - "Hooked: How to Build Habit-Forming Products"
- Self-Determination Theory (Ryan & Deci) - intrinsic motivation research
- Cal Newport - "Digital Minimalism" - attention and focus principles

## Notes for Implementation

**For designers and developers:**
- Every feature must support at least one Design Pillar
- When in doubt, ask: "Does this align with our inviolable principles?"
- Reference the mission and north-star when evaluating trade-offs
- Pillars are decision filters: if a feature doesn't support a pillar, reconsider it

**For Level 2 (Stable Truths):**
- Translate these philosophical foundations into concrete design strategies
- Define HOW we'll achieve these experiences through architectural commitments

**Remember:**
- This document should NEVER change based on implementation details
- If you're tempted to modify Level 1, ask whether the philosophy truly changed, or just the implementation approach
