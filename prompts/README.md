# AI Assistant Prompt Library

Complete, detailed prompts for working with the Hierarchical Specification Framework v3.5.2.

These prompts are designed for use with AI assistants (like Claude, GPT-4, etc.) to help you create, maintain, and evolve your product specifications.

## Available Prompts

| Prompt | Use Case | File |
|--------|----------|------|
| **Initialize Spec** | Create a new specification from scratch (greenfield) | [initialize-spec.md](initialize-spec.md) |
| **Adopt Framework for Existing Project** | Apply framework to existing codebase (brownfield) | [adopt-framework-existing.md](adopt-framework-existing.md) |
| **Migrate Spec** | Upgrade specification to newer framework version | [migrate-spec.md](migrate-spec.md) |
| **Validate Spec** | Comprehensive validation of existing specification | [validate-spec.md](validate-spec.md) |
| **Add Feature** | Add new feature to existing specification | [add-feature.md](add-feature.md) |
| **Generate Docs** | Create PRDs, TDDs, and other artifacts from spec | [generate-docs.md](generate-docs.md) |
| **Review Feature** | Validate implementation against specification | [review-feature.md](review-feature.md) |
| **Tips & Best Practices** | AI usage tips, common commands, troubleshooting | [tips-and-best-practices.md](tips-and-best-practices.md) |

## How to Use These Prompts

1. **Choose the appropriate prompt** for your task from the table above
2. **Read the prompt file** to understand what it does and any prerequisites
3. **Copy the entire prompt** from the markdown code block
4. **Replace placeholders** (marked with `[brackets]`) with your specific details
5. **Paste into your AI assistant** conversation
6. **Provide requested information** as the AI asks follow-up questions

## Quick Start

### For New Projects (Greenfield)

Start with [initialize-spec.md](initialize-spec.md) to create your first specification from scratch.

### For Existing Projects (Brownfield)

Use [adopt-framework-existing.md](adopt-framework-existing.md) to apply the framework to an existing codebase or product.

### For Validating Specifications

Use [validate-spec.md](validate-spec.md) to check if your specification follows framework rules correctly.

### For Framework Version Migration

Use [migrate-spec.md](migrate-spec.md) when updating to a newer version of the framework.

## Customizing Prompts

Each prompt is designed to be comprehensive and cover common scenarios. You can:

- **Remove sections** not relevant to your project type
- **Add domain-specific requirements** to fit your industry (e.g., healthcare compliance, gaming mechanics)
- **Adjust detail level** based on project complexity (simpler for MVPs, more detailed for complex systems)
- **Modify examples** to match your product domain

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Be specific** - The more context you provide about your product, the better the AI can help
2. **Answer follow-up questions thoroughly** - AI assistants use your answers to generate better specifications
3. **Review and refine** - Treat AI-generated content as a draft; review and refine based on your expertise
4. **Iterate** - It's okay to regenerate sections if they don't match your vision
5. **Use validation** - Regularly use the validation prompt to ensure hierarchy rules are followed

## Contributing

If you create custom prompts or improvements to existing ones, consider contributing them back to the framework repository.

## Version Compatibility

These prompts are designed for **Hierarchical Specification Framework v3.5.2**.

For earlier versions, see the framework's [CHANGELOG.md](../CHANGELOG.md) for migration guidance.
